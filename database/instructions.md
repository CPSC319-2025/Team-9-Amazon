# Database Instructions

## Database Setup
You can set up the database by running the following command:
```
mysql -u bobj0n3s -p -h recruit-dev.c7wsa48a6mzl.ca-central-1.rds.amazonaws.com < setup.sql
```
Note that the endpoint can change if we restart the database instance
Currently, the password for the databse is `1234Recruit!`, I'll get on better security measures later
